TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Make sure your path has no spaces
2. Your filename has no wierd characters
3. Java/ADB are in your path
4. It's not a themed apk (if it is, expect .9 png errors, use as close to stock as possible)
5. Look at the log to know whats happening
6. If all else fails, post as much info as possible and we will try to assist you.
